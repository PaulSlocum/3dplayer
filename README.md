# 3dplayer
### 3D WebGL mp3 player using THREE.js and Web Audio API.

In early development -- currently only the play and pause button work, and it is not yet configured well for mobile.

[Link to working project demo page](https://paulslocum.github.io/3dplayer/)

Planned features: 
 - load an "album" by specifying a list of MP3 files in the script call parameters
 - simulated compact disc player operation including play, pause, stop, track forward and back, fast forward, rewind, etc.
 - disc player sound effects and animated disc drawer
 - working treble and bass tone controls
 - realtime spectrum analyzer display
 - realtime enviromental visualizations that respond to playing music
